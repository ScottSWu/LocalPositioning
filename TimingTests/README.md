### Timing tests under different languages

Before I learned the difference between RTOS and other kernel types, I was interested in how consistently a system could measure time. This folder contains a set of scripts that measure jitter.


### .cpp

gcc -O3 <file.cpp> -o <file.x>
./file.x

### .py
python -m compileall .
python <file.pyc>
